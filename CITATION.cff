abstract: >-
  COFE is a novel unsupervised machine learning approach
  that can use single high-throughput omics samples (without
  time labels) from individuals to reconstruct circadian
  rhythms across cohorts. COFE can simultaneously assign
  time labels to samples and identify rhythmic data features
  used for temporal reconstruction, while also detecting
  invalid orderings.
